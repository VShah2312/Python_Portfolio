Question: What is parameters? What is arguments? 
Answer: Parameters are data that goes into function while calling it. 
If parameters are specified, then they are required to enter exact number of parameters while calling a function.
Keep in mind: Parameters are what you are sending in. Arguments what we are accepting.
